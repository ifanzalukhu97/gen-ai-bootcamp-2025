## Use Case  
A Bahasa Indonesia Learning School aims to extend its language offerings and enhance the student learning experience between instructor-led classes.  

## Key Levers of Cost  
In the initial phase, to validate market demand without heavy upfront investment in hardware, the company chooses not to invest in dedicated devices. Instead, it leverages cloud services offering **on-demand pricing for Tokens-as-a-Service**, such as Groq or similar providers.  

However, as the user base grows and costs increase, the company will **simultaneously plan and evaluate** the feasibility of running a dedicated server—either on-premise or in the cloud—to **reduce reliance on per-token pricing**.  

From a business perspective, the company will also provide an option for users/students to **bring their own API key (BYOK)**. Those who supply their own key will be offered a different subscription pricing model.  

Additionally, for users/students who **do not use their own API key** and fully rely on the system's provided key, **a fair usage policy** will be implemented to prevent excessive costs and mitigate potential abuse. However, users/students who bring their own key will **not have any usage limitations or restrictions**.
